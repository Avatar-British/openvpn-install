**Update: For the easy start, I just imported the exact repository from [Nyr] (https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) GitHub side, all the credits should belongs to him.**

## openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS and Fedora.

I had my preferences and parameters on the OpenVPN server settings, 
I decided to create this GitHub to record my changes upon [Nyr] scripts and efforts.

I noticed my previous scripts have not been working very well, due to the OpenVPN upgrade of their program structures.
I revised the repository again with reference from [Nyr].

(Again, thank you to [Nyr] selfless contribution and sharing, and the help of HAK5 introduce the great scripts)

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. 
It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.


### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/Jqclp -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
